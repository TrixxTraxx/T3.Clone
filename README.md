This repository is my planned submission to the T3 Cloneathon build using C# and Blazor WASM
Certainly! Here's the same Markdown content without a code block, just as plain text:

Style my Login Page with the following style provided in the screenshot,
implement the AuthLayout so that is a standalone page!
Dont change how it works, just change how it looks!
Use MudBlazor Styles and Sytyle Variables, a Mod Theme is available!
Style the Blazor Components using the app.css using exclusively classes! (no Style Tags!!)
Now also implement the Account/Manage Pages so the Layout, Profile, Email, Password and External Logins page. 2FA and Account Deletions do not need to be styled!
